# openui5espresso

## This is the accompanying code for my book SAP OpenUI5 for Mobile BI and Analytics. Available on Amazon https://goo.gl/QkRh8k
There are five (5) business use cases for Airline, Oil and Gas, Banking and Finance, Telecommunications and Retail. These are introduced in Chapter 3 (Design Thinking) and in Chapters 6 and 7, I go into building two of these mockups into functioning prototypes using SAP OpenUI5. 1. Airline - webapp built using Standard tiles from the sap.m library
2. Telecommunications - webapp built using custom controls and d3.js for charts and graphs
